### This dataset is the original dataset for this study

The dataset includes groundwater well data, digital elevation model data, climate data and soil data for the lower Tarim River.

Climate variables from the Worldclim website, via https://www.worldclim.org/. The climate dataset includes nineteen climate variables, BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature, BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly  (max temp - min temp)), BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7)  (×100), BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard  deviation ×100), BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month, BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month, BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6), BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter, BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter, BIO12 = Annual Precipitation, BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month, BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month, BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality  (Coefficient of Variation), BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter, BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter, BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter, BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest  Quarter

Soil property information was obtained based on the 2020 soil dataset from the World Soil Database (HWSD) of the National Tibetan Plateau Scientific Data Center, via https://soilgrids.org/. The six soil variables include the sand content, silt content and clay content of the upper soil layer (0-30 cm) and the lower soil layer (30-100 cm), respectively. 

The elevation (from Digital Elevation Model data)  adopts Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Network Information Center Geospatial Data Cloud ASTER GDEM 30m resolution series data (http://www.gscloud.cn/sources)

Monthly groundwater data from the lower Tarim River groundwater monitoring wells, via https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/zh-hans/data/1aa5bcea-f637-41f1-88e4-2296ed712e7b.
